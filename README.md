# sms-classification
NLP algorithm to classsify SMS messages.

in this repository i have share me NLP work using cutting edge deep learning techonologies like Convnet and Word embeddings,
to classify the sms messages to categories such as delivery, payment, appointment, payment, pickup and other whole 12
categories to help manage the message inbox. the algorithm was able to predict the classes with accuracy of over 99%  which
is state of the art result on validation data.
hence we can strongly aggree that this can predict the classes well on test data with a decent accuracy.
